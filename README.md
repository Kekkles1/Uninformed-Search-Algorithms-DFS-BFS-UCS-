Implemented uninformed search algorithms (DFS,BFS,UCS) for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class assignment. Program reads movie data and finds search path from movie1 to movie2. 
All the movies on this path become recommendations for the user. If a user has watched movie1 and movie2, then we want to recommend movies which lie on the spectrum between these two movies. The idea is to use
the graph and search for movies which lie between movie1 and movie2.
